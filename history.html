        <div class="story-content">
            <p>Cashew was established because cashews are among the rarest, most unique, and hardest-to-find items in
                Manila. The business began in 2008, initiated by <span class="highlight-text">the founder's
                    grandmother</span>, with initial products
                consisting of onions and goods from a sari-sari store. It was <span class="highlight-text">the founder's
                    mother</span> who innovated and
                sought out new products, noticing a high demand for cashews among buyers. She decided to become a
                supplier, sourcing them and eventually expanding the offerings to include various nuts.</p>

            <p>The original location was in the Lumang palengke, situated in I Mall during the era of the old
                palengke. However, due to Leyble, the store closed in 2015, and the palengke relocated across from
                Robinson to the new palengke. The family then searched for ways to resume sales, eventually securing a
                spot within the old palengke and town area, where operations continued. Today, the store is conveniently
                located in <span class="highlight-text">Sta. Ana Bldg., F. Manalo St., Brgy. San Jose, Antipolo
                    City</span>, making it easily accessible for
                customers in the region.</p>

            <p>Later, the mother fell ill but continued managing the business, while her son began selling products
                online to support the family's finances. After the mother's passing, the family honored her legacy by
                <span class="highlight-text"> continuing to run the store with the same passion and dedication</span>
                she had shown throughout the years.
            </p>

            <p>Today, Cashew Manila stands as a testament to three generations of hard work, resilience, and love. From
                a grandmother's sari-sari store to a mother's vision for premium nuts, and now carried forward by the
                next generation, our story is one of family, perseverance, and an enduring commitment to bringing the
                finest cashews and nuts to Filipino homes. We've earned national recognition, expanded internationally,
                and built a legacy that continues to grow but our commitment remains unchanged: <span
                    class="highlight-text">Made with Hearth, Taste
                    Like Gold</span>. Every product we sell carries the spirit of those who came before us, and their
                legacy
                continues in every carefully selected nut we offer.</p>
